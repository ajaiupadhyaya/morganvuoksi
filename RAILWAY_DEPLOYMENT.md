# üöÄ Railway.app Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Railway.app

Your MorganVuoksi Terminal is now optimized for Railway.app deployment with all dependency conflicts resolved!

## üéØ What's Fixed

‚úÖ **Dependency Conflicts Resolved**
- Fixed `websockets` vs `alpaca-trade-api` conflict
- Updated to `alpaca-py` for better compatibility
- Optimized requirements for production deployment

‚úÖ **Railway-Specific Optimizations**
- Created `requirements-railway.txt` with production-optimized dependencies
- Updated Dockerfile for Railway.app
- Added Railway configuration file
- Removed heavy dependencies (torch, cvxopt) for faster builds

## üöÄ Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
Your code is already pushed to GitHub at: `https://github.com/ajaiupadhyaya/morganvuoksi.git`

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway.app

#### Option A: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Connect your GitHub account
5. Select the `morganvuoksi` repository
6. Railway will automatically detect your Dockerfile and deploy

#### Option B: Command Line
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
# Required for Streamlit
STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=$PORT
STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
STREAMLIT_SERVER_HEADLESS=true
STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_CORS=false
STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_XSRF_PROTECTION=false

# Your API Keys (replace with actual values)
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_key
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_key
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
```

## üîß Configuration Files

### `requirements-railway.txt`
- Optimized dependencies for Railway.app
- Removed heavy packages (torch, cvxopt)
- Fixed websockets version conflicts

### `Dockerfile`
- Updated for Railway.app deployment
- Uses Python 3.11 for better performance
- Includes health checks and security improvements

### `railway.json`
- Railway-specific configuration
- Health check settings
- Restart policies

## üåê Access Your App

After deployment, Railway will provide you with:
- **Default URL**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **Custom Domain**: You can add your own domain in Railway dashboard

## üìä Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring:
- **Logs**: View real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Health Checks**: Automatic health monitoring
- **Deployments**: Track deployment history

## üîÑ Updates

To update your deployment:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. Or manually trigger: `railway up`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Check Railway logs for specific errors
- Verify all dependencies are in `requirements-railway.txt`
- Ensure Dockerfile is properly configured

### Runtime Issues
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify API keys are valid
- Check application logs for errors

### Performance Issues
- Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard
- Consider upgrading to a larger instance if needed
- Optimize code for production use

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

Railway pricing:
- **Free Tier**: $5 credit/month
- **Pro**: $20/month for 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU
