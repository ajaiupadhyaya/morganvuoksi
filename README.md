## 🔍 Project Overview

Vuoksi Quant Core (VQC) is a modular quant trading system built to:

- Generate alpha signals using machine learning and time series models
- Construct portfolios using optimization methods with risk constraints
- Execute trades and evaluate strategies under realistic conditions
- Incorporate news and sentiment via NLP for dynamic adjustment
